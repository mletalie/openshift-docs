=  Image registry mirroring for {product-title}

You can configure an existing {product-title} cluster to pull images from a mirrored registry by using the `ImageDigestMirrorSet (IDMS)` object.

IDMS defines a set of cluster-wide policies for registry mirroring. It intercepts image pull requests that identify an image by its unique content-addressable digest. Based on these policies, the IDMS transparently redirects the pull operation from its specified source registry to one or more designated mirror registries.

The benefits of configuring your {product-title} to pull images from a mirrored registry using IDMS include:

** *Enhanced Security*: By forcing image pulls from a private, mirrored registry, you can scan and approve all images for vulnerabilities before they ever enter your cluster.

** *Improved Cluster Reliability*: A local mirror guarantees stable and predictable cluster performance by eliminating reliance on public internet pathways.

** *Guaranteed Image Consistency*: IDMS uses image digests to reference images, which ensures that every node in the cluster pulls the same version of an image, preventing inconsistencies which could lead to deployment failures.


[IMPORTANT]
====
The image mirror configuration feature operates exclusively with image references by digest, meaning that image mirroring will only activate when an image is pulled using its unique and immutable ID. Any image references using a mutable tag are currently not supported by this functionality.
====


.Prerequisites


** You have installed and configured the latest ROSA CLI on your installation host.
** You have installed a {product-title} cluster.
** The {product-title} cluster must be in  **Ready** state to create, edit, list, or delete image mirrors.
** You have access to the mirror registries you want to configure.
** You have the required IAM permissions to manage cluster configurations.

.Procedure

To create an image mirror configuration for a {product-title} cluster, run the following command:

[IMPORTANT]
====
The source registry cannot be modified after creation. You must delete and recreate the image mirror to change the source.
